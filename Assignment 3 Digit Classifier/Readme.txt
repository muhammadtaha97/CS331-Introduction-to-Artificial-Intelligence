First as the assignment specifically asked, we had to input our files through console (not hardcoding). So relevant system arguments were setup. Then first the trainandtest function is called, which calls the readtrain file function. Since the file contains commas, they have to be separated. Instead empty space is put there. Then for the the first half of train file which is for "normal" people, the probabilities are calcualted as mentioned in the assignment docx for Bernoulli Bayern which is uik = n(ik)/Nk using. All the ones are calculated in the line and so are the zeroes and they are then divided by N which is 40.Numpys are used to calcualed the product of all people probs. Same is done for the abnormal people. This was training. Now comes the testing part, in which the test file is read like above, and for 22 entries each, if that person was abnormal or normal in real, then its relevant prob is appended to a numpy array and then added finally to a list. This is for all four cases. Then for finally, if our prediction by our training matched actual data, counter for correctness was incremented. Thus came the accuracy as the percentage and total time taken for program.
